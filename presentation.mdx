## Slidedecks are important

My first ever startup was called EMRChain (blockchain EMR interoperability).

- I was told I needed more twitter followers
- Also told that pretty slidedecks were non-technical and black text on white background was cracked

Shoutout to [@hardhathen](https://x.com/hardhathen) from Polychain Capital.

## Why not Slidev?

Slidev is objectively better and more complete software. But it's multi-file and complex.

## Why not Marp?

Marp has a very weird and bloated CLI.
